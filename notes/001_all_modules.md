🧱 MODULE 1: Introduction to Deequ and Data Quality Concepts
Goal: Understand what Deequ is and why it's used.

What is Amazon Deequ?

Differences between Deequ and other tools (e.g., Great Expectations)

Data quality dimensions: completeness, uniqueness, consistency, accuracy, timeliness

Overview of Deequ’s architecture

📚 Resources:

Amazon Deequ GitHub

AWS Big Data Blog: Testing data quality at scale with Deequ

🧪 MODULE 2: Constraint Verification in Deequ
Goal: Learn how to validate data with constraints.

Writing constraints for:

Completeness (e.g., "Product ID must not be null")

Uniqueness (e.g., "Batch ID should be unique")

Pattern matching (e.g., SKU format)

Numeric ranges (e.g., "Temperature must be between 0 and 5°C")

Using the VerificationSuite

🧑‍🏭 Manufacturing use case: Check for nulls or duplicates in sensor logs or production batch data.

📊 MODULE 3: Data Profiling and Constraint Suggestion
Goal: Use Deequ to understand unknown datasets.

Using ColumnProfilerRunner

Automatically suggest constraints based on existing data

Understand column distributions

🧑‍🏭 Use case: Automatically suggest checks for new production lines or SKU datasets.

📏 MODULE 4: Analyzers and Metrics Computation
Goal: Compute data quality metrics for monitoring.

Common analyzers:

Size()

Completeness()

ApproxCountDistinct()

Mean(), StandardDeviation()

Exporting metrics to JSON or S3

Comparing metrics over time

More Standard Practices:

Creating a simple custom analyzer in Scala

When and why to build custom analyzers (vs. using Compliance)

Reusing business logic in analyzers

(Optional) How to version your custom analyzers in a shared repo

🧑‍🏭 Use case: Daily stats on beverage bottle fill levels or production counts.

📈 MODULE 5: Anomaly Detection and Trend Monitoring
Goal: Spot when quality metrics change unexpectedly.

Using MetricsRepository to persist historical metrics

Time series anomaly detection in Deequ

Comparing metrics day-over-day

🧑‍🏭 Use case: Alert if the sugar content or temperature readings shift suddenly.

🔁 MODULE 6: PyDeequ – Using Deequ in Python
Goal: Operate Deequ in a Python-based data science pipeline.

Installing and using pydeequ

Running checks in a Jupyter Notebook

Integrating with Pandas → Spark workflows

📚 PyDeequ GitHub

🚀 MODULE 7: Running Deequ on AWS Infrastructure
Goal: Scale and automate data quality checks.

Run Deequ on Amazon EMR

Run Deequ with AWS Glue Jobs (preferred for serverless)

Store Deequ reports/metrics in Amazon S3

Optional: Trigger jobs with Lambda or Step Functions

🧑‍🏭 Use case: Automatically validate incoming production CSVs dropped in S3.

📑 MODULE 8: Report Generation and Visualization
Goal: Create usable insights from quality checks.

Generating Deequ reports in HTML/JSON

Custom dashboards (e.g., using Quicksight or Grafana with Athena/S3)

Notification/alerting (e.g., via SNS or Slack)

🧑‍🏭 Use case: Quality dashboard for plant managers showing pass/fail results.

🔄 MODULE 9: CI/CD and Automation for Data Quality
Goal: Embed Deequ checks into deployment or ETL cycles.

GitHub Actions / Jenkins for automating Deequ jobs

Quality gates: fail a pipeline if constraints break

Versioning of constraints and metrics
